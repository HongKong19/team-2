  companyAbout:
    "Health In Action was established in 2011 and is a registered non-governmental organization in Hong Kong. Our vision is to eliminate health inequity in societies and we firmly believe that health is a fundamental human right for all, irrespective of race, religion, gender or political affiliation. We aspire to drive positive social change through cycles of service, research, and advocacy. Our current target beneficiaries include local working poor families, ethnic minorities, and refugees. Health In Action is a member of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service and is in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council. We are committed to promote social justice through the lens of health equity. Health is a fundamental human right for all, including physical, mental, and social wellbeing. The right to health encompasses not only healthcare services, but also the conditions in which we are born, grow up, work, live, and age, namely the social determinants of health. Through working with Hong Kongâ€™s most vulnerable groups, we exemplify and underline the importance of addressing the social determinants of health in order to enable each individual to achieve health ownership. Currently, our target groups face multiple barriers in achieving health ownership. We sincerely invite individuals and organizations interested in promoting social justice and health to get in touch, to exchange ideas and to work together towards health for all, leaving no one behind."
